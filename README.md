## Results

Unfortunately, my team did not end up placing first and second BUT the Jefferson Health Hack was gracious enough to award $1,000 to all teams that participated in the final presentations. As such, I ended up winning $250 which is certainly not bad for a first hackathon. Hopefully I will be able to participate in more hackathons in the near future as this was very fun, but kind of lacking in the actual programming department. I didn't bother finishing or properly tyling anything past the landing page of the website since the hack was much more focused on the actual ideas and business models of the teams rather than their implementations, which is unfortunately my strong suite.
